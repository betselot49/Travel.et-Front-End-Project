        <h2 >Dalol to Dashen</h2>
        <article >Ethiopia is located in the Northeast of Africa, bordering Somalia and Eritrea. It has Sudan, South Sudan, and Djibouti to its east,
            Kenya to its south and northwest and the Red Sea to its northeast. It's the 27th largest country in the world, with an area of 1.1 million square km. 
            Ethiopia is largely mountainous country situated at an elevation of 2000m above sea level and lake region that lies in the Great Rift Valley zone. 
            The Ethiopian highlands cover most of the country - these are some of the oldest mountains on Earth, over 12 million years old! The highest mountain peak is Ras Dashen at 4620m.
            A major river also flows through from north to south: the Blue Nile – one of two headwaters for the Nile River. 
            Ethiopia is home to over 80 different ethnic groups with Amharic as the official language alongside English and other local dialects.</article>

                <article >The highest place in Ethiopia is Mount Ras Dejen, located on the Semien Mountains of northern Ethiopia. 
                    This volcano has an elevation of 4,533 metres (14,872ft) and sits atop a basaltic platform which has been created by thousands of 
                    years of volcanic activity. The mountain's peak is covered with snow for most of the year and provides stunning views as it rises out 
                    of a wide plain. Its unique shape gives it strong religious significance to local Ethiopians who consider this mountain sacred due to its
                    massive scale and power over nature.

                    the hottest and driest places on earth, with an average temperature above 33.5 degrees Celsius and little to no rainfall. The 14,000-square 
                    mile lowland trough stretches across Ethiopia and also into neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti. It contains three salt lakes including Lake Asale 
                    which is 216 feet below sea level, making it the second lowest point in Africa after Lake Assal in Djibouti. </article>
